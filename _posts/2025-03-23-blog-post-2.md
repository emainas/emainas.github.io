# Scheduler tricks

Recently I starting working with QM/MM Umbrella Sampling calculations. I use [Amber](https://ambermd.org) for the Molecular Mechanics part and [Terachem](http://www.petachem.com/products.html) for the electronic structure calculations. The communication between the two softwares is not a trivial issue but has been solved sufficiently with the terachem-protocol-buffer ([TCPB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36725506/)). However, the amount of files produced and memory used is massive. 20 umbrella windows alone produced ~15,000,000 files and 2.6Tb of memory which means that I started recieving the notorious "exceeded memory limits" emails from the IT department.

```bash 
echo "Hello world" 
```
