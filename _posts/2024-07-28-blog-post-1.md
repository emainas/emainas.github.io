# Research

The past week has been all about automation of the QM/MM[^1] workflow. QM/MM calculations are particurly tedious because of the extensive preparation of the system, meaning that there is a lot of case-by-case work and limited room for automation. H

[^1]: QM/MM (Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics): We treat the interesting part of the system with a quantum mechanical method like DFT and the rest of the system with a classical force field.  

# Reading

I have been reading a lot about protein-protein dissociation. It is a rather complicated topic and requires rigorous study of the available computational methods in the literature. 

# Miscalleneous stuff
